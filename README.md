# dynamic_policy_guard
Design and implement "Dynamic Policy Guard," an HTTP microservice that decouples business logic (the code) from policy logic (the data). The system must decide how to redact a given piece of information based on semantic retrieval of rules from a corpus of documents, simulating a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation/Execution) architecture.
